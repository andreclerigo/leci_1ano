Each E?? directory contains the files for a given exercise.

The programs in some exercises require the pt.ua.p2utils package.
To compile and run those programs you must download p2utils.jar
and put it in some directory, for example, in ~/lib/.
Then, run this command:

    export CLASSPATH=:$HOME/lib/p2utils.jar

After that, you can compile and run with the usual commands:

    javac Prog.java
    java -ea Prog

NOTES:

1. You may change $HOME/lib/p2utils.jar to whatever path suits you.
2. $HOME is an environment variable with your home dir.
3. These instructions should work in Linux.
4. For Windows, google "set classpath in Windows".
